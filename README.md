# MachineLearning2
This is my CA2 for my Year 2 Sem 1 Machine Learning Module. This comes with 2 sets of code, one for a Time Series Model and one for a
Unsupervised Learning Model.

Time Series:

The Time Series model uses the data "train.csv" and "test.csv" as given by my school. It contains the Temperature, Relative Humidity, 
and pollution value for each type of gas. This Time Series model aims to predict air pollution values.


Unsupervised Learning:

This Unsupervised Learning model uses the data "mall_customers.csv" that contains the Customer ID, Gender, Age, Annual Income, and their Spending Score.
This Unsupervised Learning model aims to cluster the mall customers so that we can give useful insights on each group. (See code/ppt for insights)
